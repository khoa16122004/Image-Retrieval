## Image-Retrieval

### Anime dataset

The dataset of some animals was collected by me. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a direct link to the dataset here. Please provide an alternate way for me to access the dataset.

### Method

To perform image retrieval, we can use the [https://github.com/openai/CLIP]{CLIP} (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model along with [https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss]{Faiss}, a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

Here are the high-level steps to follow:

1. **Preprocess the dataset**: Convert the images into tensors and normalize them.

2. **Load the CLIP model**: Download and load the CLIP model, which consists of a vision encoder and a text encoder.

3. **Encode images**: Pass the preprocessed images through the vision encoder to obtain image embeddings.

4. **Build an index**: Use Faiss to build an index from the image embeddings for efficient similarity search.

5. **Retrieve similar images**: Take a query image, encode it using the vision encoder, and use the Faiss index to find the most similar images based on the embeddings.

By following these steps, you can perform image retrieval using the CLIP model and Faiss.
